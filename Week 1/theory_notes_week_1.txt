📘 Week 1: Python Basics - Theory Notes
--------------------------------------

🔹 What is Python?
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. 
It is widely used in web development, data science, AI/ML, automation, and more.

Python executes code line by line (interpreted) and does not require manual compilation.

--------------------------------------

🔹 Features of Python:
- Easy to learn and use
- Cross-platform (works on Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Open-source and free
- Huge library support (NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow)
- Object-Oriented and Dynamically Typed

--------------------------------------

🔹 Basic Concepts

1️⃣ Variables:
A variable is used to store data that can be reused later.

Example:
name = "Mehak"
age = 21

2️⃣ Data Types:
Common data types in Python:
str → Strings ("Hello")
int → Integers (10)
float → Decimal numbers (3.14)
bool → Boolean values (True / False)

Example:
city = "Delhi"
height = 5.9
is_student = True

3️⃣ Operators:
Used to perform operations on variables and values.
Arithmetic: +, -, *, /, %, **
Comparison: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
Logical: and, or, not

Example:
x = 10
y = 5
print(x + y)      # 15
print(x > y)      # True
print(x == 10 and y < 10)  # True

4️⃣ Input and Output:
To take user input → input()
To display output → print()

Example:
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello,", name)

5️⃣ String Concatenation:
Joining two or more strings.

first = "Python"
second = "Rocks"
print(first + " " + second)

6️⃣ Comments:
Used to explain your code.
Single-line comment: starts with #
Multi-line comment: enclosed in triple quotes """ ... """

Example:
# This is a single-line comment
"""
This is a 
multi-line comment
"""

7️⃣ Errors:
Common types:
SyntaxError → wrong code structure
NameError → using undefined variable
TypeError → wrong data type operation

Example:
# NameError Example
print(agee)  # 'agee' not defined
